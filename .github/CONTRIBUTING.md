# Contributing

I welcome contributions.

## Issues

Feel free to file whatever feature requests or bug reports you have. I can't guarantee that I'll respond.

## Pull Requests

I want to merge your pull requests. If you want me to merge your pull requests then you want to make it easy for me to merge and hard for to say no to you.

Here are some things you can double-check to make it harder for me to say no to you:

* Any new additions to the public interface have documentation comments.
* Running `yarn build` succeeds.
* Running `yarn docs` succeeds.
* Running `yarn start` in the example folder works.
* Running `yarn test` succeeds without any test failures or linting errors.
* You haven't accidentally added any console logs.

If you want to make a pull request but don't know where to start, there's a [Github project](https://github.com/users/rheber/projects/4) containing the currently planned work. There's no timeline though.
